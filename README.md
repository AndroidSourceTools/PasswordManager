## Built With :nut_and_bolt:
* [Room Persistance Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - This library provides an abstraction over SQLite and makes it a lot simpler to save and fetch data from a device's database.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Coroutines are used to perform two or more tasks parallely or asynchronously. They are very useful when you need to load data from cloud into your app.
* [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) - Native Development Kit, enables you to write some part of your app's code in C language which makes it difficult to recover the encryption keys or API keys on reverse engineering.
